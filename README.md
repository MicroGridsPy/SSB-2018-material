Multi-Energy System Py (MES-Py)
========================

### Description

The Multi-Energy System Py (MES-Py) model main objective is to provide an open-source alternative to the problem of sizing and dispatch of energy in multi-energy systems in isolated places. It’s written in python(pyomo) and use excel and text files as input and output data handling and visualization.

Main features:

    Optimal sizing of: a) Lion-Ion batteries, diesel generators and PV panels; and b) hot water tanks, solar thermal collectors and LPG boilers in order to supply a single-node electricity demand and a multi-node thermal demand with the lowest cost possible.
    Optimal dispatch from different energy sources.
    Calculation of the net present cost of the system for the project lifetime.
    Determination of the LCOE for the optimal system.

### Required libraries

The python libraries needed to run Micro-Grids are the following:

    -Pyomo Optimization object library, interface to LP solver (e.g. CPLEX)
    -Pandas for input and result data handling
    -Matplotlib for plotting
